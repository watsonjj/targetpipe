    Obtain the signal provided by the pedestal in the pulse spectrum.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : 1darray
        The x values to evaluate at
    norm : float
        Integral of the zeroth peak in the distribution, represents p(0)
    eped : float
        Distance of the zeroth peak from the origin
    eped_sigma : float
        Sigma of the zeroth peak, represents electronic noise of the system
    lambda_ : float
        Poisson mean

    """
    Obtain the signal provided by photoelectrons in the pulse spectrum.

    Parameters
    ----------
    k : int or 1darray
        The NPEs to evaluate. A list of NPEs can be passed here, provided it
        is broadcast as [:, None], and the x input is broadcast as [None, :],
        the return value will then be a shape [k.size, x.size].

        k must be greater than or equal to 1.
    x : 1darray
        The x values to evaluate at
    norm : float
        Integral of the zeroth peak in the distribution, represents p(0)
    eped : float
        Distance of the zeroth peak from the origin
    eped_sigma : float
        Sigma of the zeroth peak, represents electronic noise of the system
    spe : float
        Signal produced by 1 photo-electron
    spe_sigma : float
        Spread in the number of photo-electrons incident on the MAPMT
    lambda_ : float
        Poisson mean

    Returns
    -------
    signal : ndarray
        The y values of the signal provided by the photoelectrons. If k is an
        integer, this will have same shape as x. If k is an array,
        and k and x are broadcase correctly, this will have
        shape [k.size, x.size].
