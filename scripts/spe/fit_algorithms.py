    norm : float
        Integral of the zeroth peak in the distribution, represents p(0)

        Sigma of the zeroth peak, represents electronic noise of the system

    """
    Obtain the signal provided by photoelectrons in the pulse spectrum.

    Parameters
    ----------
    k : int or 1darray
        The NPEs to evaluate. A list of NPEs can be passed here, provided it
        is broadcast as [:, None], and the x input is broadcast as [None, :],
        the return value will then be a shape [k.size, x.size].

        k must be greater than or equal to 1.
    x : 1darray
        The x values to evaluate at
    norm : float
        Integral of the zeroth peak in the distribution, represents p(0)
    eped : float
        Distance of the zeroth peak from the origin
    eped_sigma : float
        Sigma of the zeroth peak, represents electronic noise of the system
    spe : float
        Signal produced by 1 photo-electron
    spe_sigma : float
        Spread in the number of photo-electrons incident on the MAPMT
    lambda_ : float
        Poisson mean

    Returns
    -------
    signal : ndarray
        The y values of the signal provided by the photoelectrons. If k is an
        integer, this will have same shape as x. If k is an array,
        and k and x are broadcase correctly, this will have
        shape [k.size, x.size].
